Caddy Build
===========

This repository is respoinsible for building a custom build [Caddy](https://github.com/mholt/caddy/) image for the Linux x86-64 platform with the Google DNS provider built in.
The builds are perfomed via our [Travis file](https://github.com/src-d/caddy-build/blob/master/.travis.yml) and the binaries are pushed to the releases.
